I'm an aspiring software engineer. Currently pursuing Master of Computational Data Science with a concentration in Computer Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Previously, I have interned at Meta as an Enterprise Software Engineer Intern. I have also built tech for public good at [Open Government Products, GovTech Singapore](https://www.open.gov.sg/) as an intern.
